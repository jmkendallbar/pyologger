Introduction
============

``pyologger`` is a high-level, object-oriented Python package designed to streamline the process of loading, organizing, aligning, and processing biologging data from animal-borne sensors. This package provides an intuitive framework to handle diverse types of multimodal data such as depth, accelerometry, gyroscope, magnetometer, ECG, and other physiological measurements commonly collected in animal telemetry studies.

The package is built to be modular, allowing users to flexibly process and analyze their data using a combination of Python classes and functions. It provides a core set of tools to work with complex datasets, helping researchers to manage metadata, read in raw data files, apply data processing pipelines, and visualize results interactively.

Motivation
**********

In the rapidly expanding field of animal-borne sensor research, managing the vast amount of data generated by these devices can be overwhelming. Biologging projects often require the integration of multiple sensor streams, accurate time alignment, data correction, and sophisticated analyses, all of which demand a robust and flexible data management system.

``pyologger`` was developed to address these challenges by providing a cohesive and user-friendly framework that can be customized to meet the specific needs of different research projects. By centralizing these tasks within a single package, ``pyologger`` aims to simplify the workflow for researchers, allowing them to focus more on the biological questions at hand rather than the intricacies of data handling.

Key Features
************

- **Data Loading and Organization:** ``pyologger`` includes powerful tools for reading and organizing data from various sensor types, with support for custom metadata handling to ensure that all relevant information is preserved throughout the analysis pipeline.

- **Time Alignment and Synchronization:** The package offers functions to align data streams from different sensors, accounting for potential time offsets and ensuring synchronized datasets for accurate analysis.

- **Data Processing Pipelines:** ``pyologger`` provides modular pipelines for processing biologging data, including features such as depth correction, zero-offset correction, and other signal processing techniques tailored for animal telemetry data.

- **Interactive Visualization:** Using Plotly and Streamlit, ``pyologger`` allows for interactive visualization of processed data, enabling researchers to explore their datasets dynamically and make informed decisions on analysis strategies.

- **Extensible and Modular Design:** The package is designed to be extended with additional modules and functions, allowing users to customize their workflow to fit the specific requirements of their research projects.

Limitations
***********

- **Sensor-Specific Processing:** While ``pyologger`` includes several general-purpose tools for biologging data, some processing functions are tailored for specific sensor types (e.g., depth, accelerometry) and may require adaptation for other sensors or data types.

- **Data Format Dependencies:** The package currently supports specific file formats and data structures commonly used in biologging studies. Users working with non-standard formats may need to develop custom readers or converters.

- **Computational Efficiency:** ``pyologger`` is designed with flexibility and readability in mind, which may come at the cost of computational efficiency in certain scenarios involving large datasets or real-time processing needs.

- **Limited Pre-built Analysis Functions:** While ``pyologger`` provides foundational tools for data management and processing, it does not yet include a comprehensive suite of statistical or behavioral analysis functions. Users may need to integrate additional packages or write custom code for advanced analyses.

Future Developments
*******************

- **Enhanced Sensor Support:** Expanding support for additional sensor types and data formats, making ``pyologger`` applicable to an even broader range of biologging studies.

- **Advanced Analysis Modules:** Adding more built-in functions for behavioral and ecological analysis, potentially including machine learning models for behavior classification and other advanced techniques.

- **Performance Optimization:** Improving the computational efficiency of core functions, particularly for handling large datasets or performing complex analyses in real-time.

- **User Community and Collaboration:** Encouraging contributions from the research community to enhance the functionality of ``pyologger`` and tailor it to the evolving needs of biologging research.

``pyologger`` is under active development, and contributions, feedback, and suggestions are welcome from the research community to help refine and expand its capabilities.
